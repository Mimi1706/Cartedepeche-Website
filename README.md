# Cartedepeche

This project is a website inspired from [Cartedepeche.fr](https://www.cartedepeche.fr), redesigned by [UI/UX designer Wendy Tan](https://www.behance.net/wendytan7). Cartedepeche is a french website made for users to get their official fishing card and become part of a responsible fishing association.

The main feature of this project is the new design, only the homepage is available but is responsive on all devices. A switch from french to english feature is also available through the use of react-redux.
